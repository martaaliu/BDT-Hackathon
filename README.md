# #BDTHackathon 2021 - Data Science Individual Challenge (12th-13th June 2021)

ðŸ¥‰ Placed third in the Data Science individual Hackathon organized by Nuwe and BDT (Barcelona Digital Talent) as part of this year's MWC (Mobile World Congress). 

The challenge consisted on generating a machine learning model (deep learning and neural networks not allowed) to predict the particle produced after the collision of hadrons from the measurements taken by the sensors of the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. The dataset can be found here: https://github.com/nuwe-io/bdt_hackathon

Winners were decided based on macro-average F1-score and quality of the code (structure, syntaxis, cleanliness, documentation).
